* Introduction
This role helps in setting up rsync daemon shares.

The role can be obtained from [[https://github.com/aardsoft/ansible-role-rsyncd][github]].

* Configuration
** rsyncd_shares
A dict with share names as key, and a list of rsync configuration options as value.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
rsyncd_shares:
  opensuse:
    - uid = nobody
    - path = /srv/mirrors/opensuse
    - hosts allow = 10.42.10.0/32 172.30.0.0/32
#+END_SRC

** rsyncd_firewall_zones
A list of configured firewalld zones to enable rsyncd in. Note that this will require the variable =firewalld_available= to be set to =true= to work - in which case firewalld must be running, otherwise the role will throw an error.

Instead of manually setting this variable the role can also be used after running the [[https://github.com/aardsoft/ansible-role-basic-host][basic-host]] role, which can configure and start firewalld, if needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
rsyncd_firewall_zones:
  - internal
#+END_SRC
